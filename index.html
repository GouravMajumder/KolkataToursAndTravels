                    memorabilia, British Raj paintings and other displays. As night descends on Kolkata, the Victoria
                    Memorial Hall is illuminated, giving it a fairy tale look. It is interesting to note that the
                    Victoria Memorial was built without British government funds. The money required for the
                    construction of the stately building, surrounded by beautiful gardens over 64 acres and costing more
                    than 10 million was contributed by British Indian states and individuals who wanted favours with the
                    British government. At the top of the Victoria Memorial is a sixteen foot tall bronze statue of
                    victory, mounted on ball bearings. It rotates with wind.</p>
